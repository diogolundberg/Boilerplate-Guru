# System Requirements

## For Users
To use Boilerplate Guru effectively, the following environment is required:
-   **Modern Web Browser**: Supports ES6 Modules, Flexbox/Grid, and IndexedDB (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+).
-   **Internet Connection (Initial)**: Required for the first load to synchronize the "Ancient Knowledge" from the GitHub repository.
-   **LocalStorage/IndexedDB Enabled**: Required for persistent offline access.

## For Developers
The project is built with a modern, lightweight stack:
-   **React 19**: Leveraging the latest UI patterns.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
-   **Fuse.js**: For high-performance client-side fuzzy searching.
-   **idb**: A small wrapper around IndexedDB for better developer experience with Promises.
-   **GitHub Raw API**: Serves as the back-end, hosting the JSON catalog and detail files.

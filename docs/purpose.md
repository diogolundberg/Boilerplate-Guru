# Boilerplate Guru: Purpose & Overview

## The Vision
**Boilerplate Guru** is a curated sanctuary of production-ready software architecture scaffolds. In an era of "JavaScript fatigue" and "choice paralysis," the Guru provides a definitive starting point for developers who value clean, scalable, and battle-tested patterns.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this application is to serve as a fast, offline-first catalog of architectural "blueprints." Instead of reinventing the wheel for every project, developers can:
1.  **Discover**: Search through a collection of scaffolds categorized by language, framework, and architectural style (e.g., Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, SPA, SSR).
2.  **Learn**: Understand the folder structure and design patterns (Adapters, Services, Entities) used in each boilerplate.
3.  **Implement**: Use the provided code samples and structure overviews to kickstart their local development environment.

## Design Philosophy
-   **Pixel Aesthetics**: A retro-themed UI that pays homage to the "Ancient Wisdom" of programming.
-   **Performance**: Extremely lightweight with minimal dependencies.
-   **Resilience**: Operates seamlessly offline using modern browser storage technologies.
-   **Simplicity**: Agnostic data fetching that treats GitHub as a CMS.
